      '**Bitcoin** began as a breakthrough in decentralized money. It\'s the most secure blockchain ‚Äî but was never designed for scalability or complex programmability.',
      '**Stacks changes that.** It\'s a Bitcoin Layer designed to bring **smart contracts and DeFi functionality to Bitcoin** ‚Äî without changing Bitcoin itself.',
      'Stacks operates as a separate blockchain that **settles to Bitcoin** through **Proof of Transfer (PoX)**, linking both chains cryptographically. This ensures Stacks\' **history and security are ultimately secured by Bitcoin\'s hashpower**.',
      'With the **Nakamoto release**, Stacks reaches **full Bitcoin finality** ‚Äî once a Bitcoin block is confirmed, Stacks transactions are final too. To reorganize a Stacks block, you\'d have to reorganize Bitcoin itself!',
      '**Why STX token?** It maintains **decentralization** by rewarding miners and signers who secure Bitcoin-pegged assets like sBTC. Without it, the system would rely on trusted intermediaries.',
      '**sBTC** is a 1:1 Bitcoin-backed token on Stacks. It enables Bitcoin holders to participate in DeFi without selling their BTC. Quick conversions happen within **3 Bitcoin blocks for deposit, 6 for withdrawal**.'
