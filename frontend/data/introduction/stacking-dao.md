# StackingDAO

## What is STX Stacking?

Stacking is the process of locking your STX tokens to earn Bitcoin rewards while helping secure the Stacks blockchain. This can be done through pooled participation or DeFi-enabled liquid stacking, offering users flexibility and accessibility.

Stacking is the core incentive mechanism that powers the Stacks network and links it directly to Bitcoin. But how does it actually work, and how can users take advantage of it?

This guide covers everything you need to know about STX Stacking and explains how StackingDAO compares to other options.

## Understanding STX Stacking

Stacking involves holding and temporarily locking STX on the Stacks blockchain — similar to how ETH is staked on Ethereum or SOL on Solana.

The difference is that **STX Stacking rewards users with native BTC directly on Bitcoin Layer 1**.

Solo Stacking requires locking about **90,000 STX** and running a node, which is not practical for most users.

To make participation easier, users can join community stacking pools, allowing them to stack with as little as **100 STX** and earn BTC or STX rewards every cycle (approximately every two weeks).

## Liquid Stacking

Another alternative is **Liquid Stacking**, where users deposit STX into a protocol and receive a tokenized version of their stacked assets (such as **stSTX** or **stSTXbtc**). These tokens can be used across DeFi while still earning the Stacking yield at the end of each cycle.

Users can also swap or unstack their liquid tokens back to STX at any time.

## Native Stacking vs. Liquid Stacking

Choosing between native and liquid stacking depends on your time horizon and flexibility needs.

### Native Stacking

- Ideal for long-term holders who want to avoid smart contract risk
- Yield takes 2–4 weeks to accumulate and unstacking may take another full cycle
- Users should only choose this option if they plan to stack continuously — otherwise, yield loss becomes significant

### Liquid Stacking

Offers more flexibility:
- Users can access their STX anytime
- Earn BTC or STX yield
- Enjoy immediate rewards without missing a cycle (exclusive to StackingDAO)
- Use liquid stacking tokens in DeFi to earn extra yield

This added flexibility usually comes with slightly higher fees compared to native stacking.

## Liquid Stacking Solutions

The main advantage of Liquid Stacking is that users can earn stacking rewards while using liquid tokens (like stSTX and stSTXbtc) in DeFi — and easily convert them back to STX at any time.

### What makes StackingDAO's Liquid Stacking stand out?

#### 1. Immediate Yield

Thanks to its design, stSTX and stSTXbtc start earning yield instantly, with no waiting period.

Users migrating from other stacking pools begin earning rewards right away, even if their tokens aren't yet included in the current stacking cycle.

This is possible because deposits made during an ongoing cycle still receive yield for that same cycle.

#### 2. Decentralized Signer Set

StackingDAO delegates STX to a network of 10+ signers and validators, including enterprise-grade providers such as **Luganodes** and **Chorus One** — both known for their strong uptime and experience managing billions in stacked assets.

The delegated STX remains fully controlled by StackingDAO's smart contracts, enhancing decentralization and strengthening the Stacks network's security.

#### 3. Extensive DeFi Integration

stSTX is currently the most integrated asset in Stacks DeFi, with over 50% deployed across DeFi protocols.

Users can lend, borrow, provide liquidity, or swap stSTX on decentralized exchanges.

Meanwhile, stSTXbtc is already integrated with Zest Protocol for lending, with more integrations on the way.

## stSTX vs. stSTXbtc

- **stSTX**: Represents tokenized, stacked STX and can be used across DeFi dApps. It offers up to 10% APY with auto-compounding STX rewards.

- **stSTXbtc**: Backed 1:1 with STX, this token provides sBTC rewards streamed directly to wallets at the end of each stacking cycle.

stSTX suits users bullish on STX, especially with its auto-compounding feature, while stSTXbtc appeals to more risk-averse investors who prefer stable BTC yields.

Additionally, both tokens earn points for holders, and users receive bonus points when using them in DeFi.

For those wanting flexibility, StackingDAO enables one-click swaps between stSTX and stSTXbtc, with no unstacking or slippage.

## Native Stacking with StackingDAO

StackingDAO also caters to native stackers seeking zero exposure to smart contract risk and committed to holding STX long-term.

With a two-week unstacking period and potential yield loss when switching pools, the DAO's **0% fee native stacking pool** offers the most efficient solution over time.

Users also earn 1 point for every 2 STX deposited in this native option.

## Conclusion

The Stacks ecosystem offers diverse stacking options to suit every type of user — whether you prefer earning BTC or STX, maximizing yield through DeFi participation, or minimizing risk through native stacking.

StackingDAO addresses all these preferences with solutions designed for every kind of stacker — positioning itself as the **ultimate hub for Stacks and Bitcoin stacking**.
