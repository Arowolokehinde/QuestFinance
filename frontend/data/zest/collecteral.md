# Bitcoin as Prime Collateral

**BTC is the most recognised, liquid, and widely held cryptocurrency**. With a market cap of over $2 trillio&#x6E;**, much of it sits idle—despite being ideal collateral**, ready to be put to work.

In this market, early movers have the advantage. Control over liquidity translates directly into competitive edge, and access to capital ultimately determines who wins.

**Bitcoin-backed lending represents a trillion-dollar opportunity—and it’s a winner-takes-all race**. The leading player will be a DeFi protocol. The data speaks for itself: DeFi lending now surpasses CeFi in market share.

**Zest Protocol is at the forefront of this shift. With 500+ sBTC**—over 10% of all sBTC on Stacks—deposited within just a few months, Zest already rivals leading lending protocols on Ethereum L2s and Solana in terms of BTC supply.

Zest went from zero to one on Stacks. Now, as sBTC supply expands rapidly, **Stacks is on course to become the leading Bitcoin layer** by BTC usage—**and Zest’s share of sBTC is poised to grow in step.**

**By setting the benchmark for Bitcoin-backed lending, Zest is well positioned to lead as BTC DeFi scales.**
