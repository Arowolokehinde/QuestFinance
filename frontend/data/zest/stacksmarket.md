# How to use Stacks Market to Earn Yield

## Depositing Assets

Visit [https://app.zestprotocol.com](https://app.zestprotocol.com/) and connect a Stacks wallet. We currently support [Leather](https://leather.io/), [Xverse](https://www.xverse.app/), [OKX Wallet](https://www.okx.com/web3), [Fordefi](https://fordefi.com/), and [Asigna](https://asigna.io/).

Under **‘Assets to supply’**, select the asset you wish to earn yield on and click **‘Supply’**.\
Approve the transaction in the wallet pop-up.&#x20;

Once the **“Transaction Broadcast”** window appears, wait a few seconds for confirmation on the Stacks network.

Once confirmed, your supply position becomes active and begins earning continuously compounding yield. Your active lending position can be found under **‘Your Supplies’**.

That’s all there is to it.

## Withdrawing Assets

When you're ready to stop earning yield, click **‘Withdraw’** on the asset you wish to redeem under **‘Your Supplies’**. Once the transaction confirms, your assets will be returned.

If you select **‘Max’**, you’ll receive your full balance—original deposit plus accrued yield.
