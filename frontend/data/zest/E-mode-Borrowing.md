# E-Mode Borrowing

## What is E-Mode?

E-Mode is designed to enhance capital efficiency when the collateral and borrowed assets closely track each other in price. Since **STX**, **stSTX**, and **stSTXbtc** are highly correlated, users can safely borrow more of these assets compared to standard borrowing parameters.

In E-Mode, users benefit from:\
– **80% maximum Loan-to-Value (LTV)**\
– **85% Liquidation Threshold**\
– **5% Liquidation Penalty**

For example, with $1,000 in STX / stSTX / stSTXbtc as collateral, a user can borrow up to **$800** in STX or stSTX—compared to only **$500** in standard mode.

|                       | Traditional Borrowing | E-Mode Borrowing |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| Max LTV               | 50%                   | 80%              |
| Liquidation Threshold | 75%                   | 85%              |
| Liquidation Penalty   | 10%                   | 5%               |

## How to Activate E-Mode?

**How to Activate E-Mode**

1. First, ensure you’ve supplied either **STX**, **stSTX**, or **stSTXbtc**, and that one of them is marked as your collateral asset.
2. In the **‘Your Borrows’** section, click the **E-Mode** button. A pop-up will display the assets eligible for E-Mode. Proceed to activate it from there.
