## Bitcoin as the Ultimate Collateral

Bitcoin (BTC) is the most recognized, liquid, and widely held cryptocurrency. With a market capitalization above **$2 trillion**, much of it remains idle, despite being ideal collateral ready to be put to work.

In today's markets, liquidity equals advantage. Control over liquidity and access to capital determine long-term success.

**Bitcoin-backed lending represents a trillion-dollar opportunity**, and the data is clear ‚Äî DeFi lending now surpasses CeFi in market share.
