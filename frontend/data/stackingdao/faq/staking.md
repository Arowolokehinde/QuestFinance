What is Stacking DAO, and how does it work?
Stacking DAO is the STX Stacking infrastructure powerhouse for the most prominent Bitcoin L2. The protocol currently offers 3 STX Stacking services:

stSTX: A liquid representation of stacked STX that accrues in value in STX as Stacking rewards are auto-compounded daily. It can also be used across DeFi to earn additional yield and points.
stSTXbtc: A liquid stacking token backed 1-to-1 with STX, and holders receive sBTC rewards daily that can be claimed at any moment. stSTXbtc can also be used across Stacks dApps.
Native Stacking: Delegate STX and earn BTC rewards with zero fees while STX are locked during the two-week Stacking cycles.

How do I receive STX Stacking rewards?
The Stacking process yields BTC rewards, but they are processed in different ways based on the Stacking DAO service.

stSTX: BTC rewards are converted to STX, which are automatically placed in the smart contracts that back stSTX every 75 Bitcoin blocks. A user's stSTX balance stays the same, but when redeeming, they get their deposited STX plus stacking rewards.
stSTXbtc: BTC rewards are converted to sBTC, paid out every 75 Bitcoin blocks (around 12 hours) and claimable at any moment.
Native Stacking: BTC Rewards are deposited on the user's pre-defined Bitcoin wallet

How can I unstack my STX position?
For stSTX, you can swap them to STX anytime through Bitflow for instant liquidity.

Otherwise, for both stSTX and stSTXbtc, you can get your STX back via Stacking DAO instant unstack option (if enough idle liquidity is available). Otherwise the traditional unstack option will take up to 14 days to withdraw (length of 1 Stacking cycle).

By initiating the traditional withdrawal process on Stacking DAO, users will burn their LSTs and receive a temporary NFT that represents their withdrawal amount. Once the Stacking cycle is over, users can use the NFT to claim and withdraw their STX.

For the native stacking, it's enough to perform a "stop stacking" transaction. The STX will unlock at the end of the cycle you are currently stacked, along with your cycle rewards.

Read the docs for further information on the withdrawal process of each Stacking option.

Who are the Signers used by Stacking DAO for STX delegations?
STX is delegated to the best enterprise-grade Validators/Signers in Web3, with a track record of optimal node uptime and billions in assets under management.

These Signers are responsible for running nodes while STX tokens are safely controlled by Stacking DAO smart contracts.

The stacked STX are evenly distributed among all Signers, helping to secure the Stacks network by bootstrapping a distributed set of Signers.

Where can I use stSTX and stSTXbtc tokens?
stSTX can be used across the Stacks DeFi ecosystem to earn additional yield and points. New integrations are constantly being added and can be viewed on the Stacking DAO site.

The live integrations are:

Zest (https://www.zestprotocol.com)
Bitflow (https://www.bitflow.finance)
Velar (https://www.velar.co)
Arkadiko (https://arkadiko.finance)
Hermetica (https://hermetica.fi)
stSTXbtc is currently integrated only with Zest, where it can be deposited as collateral to borrow other assets all while earning sBTC cycle rewards.
