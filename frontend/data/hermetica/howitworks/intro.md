# How it Works

The USDh ecosystem is made up of two assets:

#### 1. USDh

A stablecoin consisting of Bitcoin coupled with a short perpetual futures position.

When Hermetica hedges Bitcoin with a short perpetual futures position, it creates a position that is price-stable in dollar terms.&#x20;

#### 2. sUSDh

A Bitcoin-native bond that generates up to 15% yield from funding rates.

USDh and sUSDh are issued natively on Bitcoin L1 via Runes and Bitcoin L2 via Stacks.

You can buy USDh on the open market via common crypto marketplaces. [Click here](https://app.hermetica.fi/buy) to get started. More markets and product integrations are coming soon.

To access the yield, users [stake USDh](https://app.hermetica.fi/stake) and immediately receive the yield-bearing token, sUSDh.
