            '**Collateral Risk**: USDh is backed by **Bitcoin held at institutional custodians** (Copper, Ceffu). While these custodians have perfect security records, custodial risk always exists. Hermetica uses **Off-Exchange Settlement and MPC wallets** to minimize this.',
            '**Exchange Risk**: Hermetica trades perpetual futures on **Binance, ByBit, Bitget, and OKX**. While diversified across 4 major exchanges, exchange outages or failures could impact operations. **Only unsettled PnL is at risk**, not the bulk of collateral which stays in custody.',
            '**Liquidity Risk**: In extreme market conditions, there may be **insufficient liquidity** to unwind large positions. Hermetica manages this by **diversifying across multiple exchanges** and maintaining positions well below market capacity ($20B+ in total open interest).',
            '**Funding Rate Risk**: If Bitcoin perpetual futures enter a **prolonged negative funding environment**, the protocol would need to pay funding rates instead of receiving them. The **Hermetica Reserve Fund** is specifically designed to cover these periods and ensure yield remains neutral or positive.',
            '**General Smart Contract Risk**: Like all DeFi protocols, USDh has **smart contract risk**. Hermetica mitigates this through **comprehensive audits by Clarity Alliance and Strata Labs**, regular security reviews, and following blockchain security best practices.'
