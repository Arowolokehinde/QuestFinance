# The Problem

#### **Stablecoins are broken.**

#### 1. 0% APY

Most stablecoins offer 0% APY. Without yield, your USD-denominated stablecoin is losing value every day due to inflation.

#### 2. Fiat-Backed

Most stablecoins (like USDC and Tether) rely on the traditional banking system. This means these stablecoins are dependent on that system to remain:

- Operational and solvent
- Friendly to crypto

These dependencies have been challenged recently, evidenced by the Silicon Valley Bank crisis which led USDC to trade 12% below peg. Read more [here](https://x.com/HermeticaFi/status/1831339868800061511).

**There is no yield-bearing dollar that is backed by the hardest asset in the world (BTC) and native to the most secure Blockchain (Bitcoin).**
